# Supplementary Information

This repository holds all supplementary source code needed to reproduce the calculations and plots of the research article “Active conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide to methane in peridotites of the Samail ophiolite, Oman” by Daniel B. Nothaft, Alexis S. Templeton, Peter B. Kelemen, Eric S. Boyd, Juerg M. Matter, and The Oman Drilling Project Science Team.

The compiled analysis files are available as [HTML reports](https://danote.github.io/Oman-14CH4/).

We hope that this code, or any part of it, might prove useful to other members of the scientific community interested in the subject matter. All code is completely open-access and can be modified and repurposed in every way. If significant portions are reused in a scientific publication, please consider citing our work. Please make sure to cite this work if re-using any of our data.
